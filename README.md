# bluefruit nrf52 CTS to RTC PCF8523

This queries the time from an iOS device over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using the CTS protocol, and sets the Realtime Clock (RTC) with the obtained time.  

This is a modification of the Adafruit example code for the Feather nrf52.  I have tested this with the Adalogger featherwing, and the nrf52832 BLE Feather.
